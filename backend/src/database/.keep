This file is used to ensure that the directory is tracked by Git, as Git does not track empty directories by default (cf. https://stackoverflow.com/a/14541263). By adding this placeholder file, we can maintain the directory structure in the repository. Once the directory contains files, this file may no longer be necessary, but it serves its purpose to keep the directory in the version control system for now. Please do not remove this file unless the directory becomes unnecessary.
