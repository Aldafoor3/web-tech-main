* The button grid layout will adapt based on the window's width,
* starting from a 6x1 grid at the narrowest windows expanding
* gradually until a 2x3 grid at 600 px window width.
* 
* If the window width is over 600 px, the 2x3 grid stays the same
* width as it was at a window width of 600 px. Because the user's
* attention is at the text, the rightmost buttons should be also near
* the start of the text.
